Dev Life Musings
====================

This is my personal blog mostly to keep notes about things I learn now and then. And sometimes to scribble about the life as a software developer too. This is built using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__, a `python`-based documentation generator and is customized to be hosted on `Github Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`__.
